# HCI-project2-Font-Design
Design a new font. The font should be for a particular type of users and/or a particular purpose (for example, for children aged 5 to 7 years, or for writing programs in C/C++). Use any font design tool to design the font. Mention and justify the design decisions. Write a paragraph of text using the new font. Upload the font file on github or similar platform and provide a link to the same. Submit the entire work as a PDF in this classroom. This project has to be done by students individually.
